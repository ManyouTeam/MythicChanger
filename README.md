## ✨ Features

### 🔹 Built-in Rules
- **45+ change rules**, including display name, lore, custom model data, enchantments, full item replacement, random replacement, and more.
- **21+ match rules**, including display name, lore, 10+ supported plugins (ItemsAdder, MMOItems, EcoItems, etc.), saved items, vanilla items, NBT, material tag, material type, and more.

### 🔹 Developer Support
- Public API to create custom change and match rules.
- Built-in **Item Format** system allows creation of any kind of item —  
  custom food, tools, attributes, armor, and beyond.

### 🔹 Change Types
- **Fake Change**: Visually alters items client-side only (server data remains unchanged).  
  For example, removing enchantments visually hides them, but their effects still apply.
- **Real Change**: Actually modifies both server and client data — the enchantment is truly gone.

### 🔹 Appearance & Text
- Full **Hex color** and **Gradient color** support.
- **Item Placeholder** support in change rules and item lore for dynamic text or stats.
- Fully supports **PlaceholderAPI** placeholders.

## 🔧 Three Change Modes
1. **Auto Match & Change** — Plugin automatically detects and modifies target items.
2. **Drag Change** — Simply drag the apply item onto the target item.
3. **GUI Change** — Open a GUI, place both items inside, and confirm the change.

## ⚙️ Advanced Features (Paid)
- **Actions & Conditions System** — Execute commands, spawn mobs, play sounds, teleport players, and more after an item change.
- **Multi Apply Item System** — Each item can accept multiple apply item types (e.g., gem or scroll system).
- **Simple Item Manager** — Save your held item or give it to players using commands. Includes NBT viewer.
- **Chat Plugin Hooks** — Integrates with InteractiveChat, TrChat, and QuickShop-Hikari to display fake-changed items.
- **Localized Item Name Translator** — Automatically downloads client language files to translate item names dynamically.
